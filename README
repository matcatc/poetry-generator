Poetry generator (poetry_generator.py) is a small simple script to generate
"poetry" given a template.

The general algorithm is that for every category-word in the template, it
replaces it with a word in that category. For example, 'noun verb adj noun'
might be turned into 'dog sees angry cat'.

A utility script (generate_wordlists.py) has been included to help with
generating the wordlists. It (currently) reads in all the words from a file
(eg: /usr/share/dict/words), classifies them by category, and places them in
the appropriate file. It currently uses wordnet to do this, so wordnet is
obviously a requirement. Running it over /usr/share/dict/words (approx 100,000
words) took somewhere between 5 - 10 minutes on my computer. I've placed the
resultant wordlists in sample_wordlists, so that you don't need to do all this
work.

The project currently can stand some clean up, and I will likely do so
eventually. Never the less, it currently works right now. So get to it:

........
./poetry_generator.py 'noun verb adj noun' -n 5
........
